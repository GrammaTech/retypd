A tool for recovering type information in binaries. It is designed to be capable of using information from re_facts, ddisasm, p-code, or other disassembly solutions. This analysis is in active development and the details of its API are expected to change.

Intended use is best demonstrated in `test/test_schema.py`'s `test_end_to_end` method: Create a `ConstraintSet` object and populate it with facts from the disassembled binary. Instantiate a Solver object with the populated ConstraintSet and a collection of interesting variables (as strings or DerivedTypeVariable objects). Call the Solver object (it needs no arguments after it is instantiated). Inferred constraints are stored in an attribute called constraints.
